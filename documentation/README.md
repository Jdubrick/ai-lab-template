# Template Specific Documentation

This directory holds all Tech Docs that are specific to each AI Software Template.

All Tech Docs for AI Software Templates that deploy applications can be found in [/app](./app/), and all Tech Docs for Templates that do *not* deploy applications can be found in [/no-app](./no-app/).

The Tech Docs contained in this directory are packaged alongside the Template content as they are designed to show up on the Template Card themselves. You can find an example of this below:
